Cloud Pak for Data System overview
Last Updated: 2024-03-06
Cloud Pak for Data System is an all-in-one cloud-native Data and AI platform in a box, that enables you to collect, organize and analyze data with unprecedented simplicity and agility, within a preconfigured and governed environment. Combining storage, compute, networking and software into plug-and-play nodes, this Intel x86-based hyper-converged infrastructure helps you accelerate private cloud deployment to a matter of hours. It can easily and elastically scale to suit your changing data and AI needs. With Cloud Pak for Data System, software and system management is simplified and you benefit from a flexible pay-as-you-go capacity model.
Hardware

Cloud Pak for Data System chassis is based on Lenovo ThinkSystem SD530. The base configuration consists of two 2U Lenovo D2 enclosures, each containing four front-access SD530 servers (nodes). The enclosures are connected with a single 25G Fabric Switch and a single 1G management switch. The base configuration can be expanded when your needs grow.

Each SD530 server is a node. Each node contains four NVMe drives and the capacity of these drives defines the type of the node.

System nodes

Physical nodes are contained in enclosures. Each enclosure contains four nodes. Nodes are assigned roles. The roles are implemented by deploying one or more virtual machines on a server node.
The bare metal servers in the system host bare metal services and one or more virtual machines. Two node roles are assigned:

Control
    Three servers in a system are always assigned a control role and these three nodes are designated as a Control Plane. These servers are candidates for a Platform Manager hub. They host one Control Virtual Machine.

    Each control node is Cloud Pak for Data System master. Master nodes manage your cluster and your Cloud Pak for Data System deployment. At least two of the three control nodes must be operational for the system to work.
Worker
    Compute nodes. They can host one or more Cloud Pak for Data System Worker Virtual Machines. Worker nodes run the services in your cluster. There are two types of worker nodes:

        Universal: Can host any service, container, or pod as designated by Cloud Pak for Data System.
        Labeled: A dedicated VM to host only a specific pod or application designated by "Label".

    When a new process starts, the control plane determines which node has sufficient capacity to run the process. Cloud Pak for Data System can continue to run when multiple worker nodes fail. However, you might notice that performance decreases when multiple nodes are down.

    Additionally, if a node fails, the control plane attempts to bring any active processes up on another node. While the control plane attempts to bring up the processes, you might experience an outage.

Network

Fabric Switch (8831-25C)

Mellanox SN2410 is a 48-port 10/25 switch with 12 additional ports that can run at 10/25/40/100. It is equipped with redundant hot-swappable fans and power supplies. The switch is running Cumulus Linux.

Data Fabric Network is the active-active 25Gb connections to the Mellanox Innova-2 SmartNICs. Innova-2 is used for Netezza and Natural Language Processing acceleration.

Management Switch (8831-S52)

Edge-core AS4610-54T-O-AC-B GigE switch (8831-S52) consists of 48 x 1G RJ-45 and 4 x 10G SFP+ and 2 x 20G QFSP+ stacking ports. It is equipped with redundant hot-swappable power supplies and redundant (not hot-swappable) fans. The switch is running Cumulus Linux.

The RJ-45 connections are to the EIOM card on the enclosure. The EIOM 1Gb connections are reserved for the management network.
